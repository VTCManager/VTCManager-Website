# VTCManager website: working version but old

# IMPORTANT: NEW VERSION AVAILABLE
The project is continued at the VCC https://github.com/VisualCableCollective .<br><br>

VTCManager is a powerful Euro Truck Simulator 2 tool. We are building something more than only a simple job logger. Together we can build something awesome! <br>
IMPORTANT: This website was in production until 19th of July 2020. All passwords are invalid and the data in the databases has been deleted.
